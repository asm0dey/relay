# Feature Specification: Relay Tunnel Service

**Feature Branch**: `001-relay-tunnel`
**Created**: 2026-02-11
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I need a quarkus app, functioning as ngrok: I should be able to to connect to the server with a secret key, server should start answering a random-named subdomain of a domain I set in settings. For example, if the main domain is tun.asm0dey.site, then random subdomain can be random-subdomain.tun.asm0dey.site. It should forward all the requests to the client of the constantly open channel. In another module I need to have a client that will be able to connect to the server with a secret key and act as a proxy between server and an actual application we're proxying"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Client Connects and Registers Tunnel (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want to run a local client that connects to the relay server using a secret key, so that I can expose my local application to the internet through a public subdomain.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the entire system. Without the ability for a client to connect and register a tunnel, no other functionality matters. This represents the minimum viable product.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting the server, running the client with a valid secret key, and verifying the client reports a successful connection with an assigned subdomain.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the relay server is running with domain `tun.example.com` configured, **When** a client connects with a valid secret key, **Then** the server assigns a random subdomain (e.g., `abc123.tun.example.com`) and the client receives confirmation with the assigned URL.

2. **Given** a client is attempting to connect, **When** the client provides an invalid secret key, **Then** the connection is rejected with an authentication error and the client is informed of the failure.

3. **Given** the relay server is unreachable, **When** the client attempts to connect, **Then** the client receives a clear connection error and can retry.

### User Story 2 - HTTP Request Forwarding (Priority: P1)

As a user with an active tunnel, I want HTTP requests made to my assigned public subdomain to be forwarded to my local application, so that external users can access my local service.

**Why this priority**: This is the second critical capability - the actual request forwarding. Combined with US1, this completes the core tunnel functionality that delivers value to users.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by making an HTTP request to the assigned subdomain and verifying it reaches the local application, with the response flowing back to the requester.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a client has an active tunnel with subdomain `abc123.tun.example.com`, **When** an HTTP GET request is made to `http://abc123.tun.example.com/api/status`, **Then** the request is forwarded to the client's local application and the response is returned to the original requester.

2. **Given** an active tunnel, **When** a POST request with a JSON body is made to the public subdomain, **Then** the complete request (headers, body, method) is preserved and forwarded to the local application.

3. **Given** a tunnel exists but the local application is not responding, **When** a request is made to the public subdomain, **Then** the requester receives an appropriate error response indicating the upstream service is unavailable.

### User Story 3 - Multiple Concurrent Tunnels (Priority: P2)

As a team lead, I want multiple clients to connect simultaneously with different subdomains, so that my team members can each expose their own local services independently.

**Why this priority**: While the system works for a single user without this, supporting multiple concurrent tunnels makes the service usable for teams and represents a significant value multiplier.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by connecting multiple clients with different secret keys, verifying each gets a unique subdomain, and confirming requests to each subdomain route to the correct client.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the server is running, **When** three clients connect with different valid secret keys, **Then** each client receives a unique random subdomain and all three can maintain simultaneous connections.

2. **Given** three active tunnels with unique subdomains, **When** requests are made to each subdomain, **Then** each request is forwarded to the correct corresponding client.

3. **Given** two clients attempt to register with the same secret key (if keys are unique identifiers), **When** the second client connects, **Then** the behavior is defined (either reject second connection or allow replacement, based on design decision).

---

### User Story 4 - Configuration and Domain Management (Priority: P3)

As a system administrator, I want to configure the base domain and other server settings, so that I can deploy the relay service with my own domain and security policies.

**Why this priority**: This enables self-hosting and customization but is not required for basic functionality. It supports operational flexibility rather than core user value.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by starting the server with custom configuration and verifying it uses the specified domain and settings.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a configuration file or environment variables specifying `BASE_DOMAIN=tun.mycompany.com`, **When** the server starts, **Then** assigned subdomains follow the pattern `*.tun.mycompany.com`.

2. **Given** configuration for secret key validation, **When** the server processes client connections, **Then** only requests with keys matching the configured validation rules are accepted.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a client disconnects unexpectedly? How long does the server wait before considering the tunnel closed?
- How does the system handle subdomain collisions if the random generator produces a duplicate?
- What happens if a request to the local application times out?
- How are large request/response bodies handled?
- What happens to in-flight requests when a client disconnects?
- How does the server handle malformed HTTP requests from external users?
- What limits exist on concurrent connections per tunnel or per client?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST allow clients to establish authenticated connections to the server using a secret key.
- **FR-002**: The server MUST generate a unique random subdomain for each connected client.
- **FR-003**: The server MUST reject connections with invalid or missing secret keys.
- **FR-004**: The server MUST forward all HTTP requests received on assigned subdomains to the corresponding connected client.
- **FR-005**: The client MUST forward received requests to a configured local application and return the response to the server.
- **FR-006**: The server MUST return the client's application response to the original requester.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST support multiple concurrent client connections, each with a unique subdomain.
- **FR-008**: The server configuration MUST allow setting the base domain for subdomain generation.
- **FR-009**: The client MUST maintain a persistent connection to the server for receiving requests.
- **FR-010**: The system MUST handle WebSocket upgrade requests in addition to standard HTTP.

### Key Entities

- **Client**: The tunnel client application that connects to the server and proxies requests to a local application. Key attributes: secret key, assigned subdomain, connection state, local target endpoint.
- **Server**: The relay server that accepts client connections and routes external requests. Key attributes: base domain, active tunnels registry, authentication configuration.
- **Tunnel**: An active connection between a client and the server representing a routable subdomain. Key attributes: subdomain name, client reference, creation time, request statistics.
- **Request**: An HTTP/WebSocket request being forwarded through the tunnel. Key attributes: method, headers, body, target subdomain.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: A user can complete the full setup (start server, start client, receive subdomain) in under 5 minutes.
- **SC-002**: HTTP requests to assigned subdomains are forwarded to the local application with less than 100ms additional latency (excluding network latency) under normal load.
- **SC-003**: The system supports at least 100 concurrent active tunnels without degradation.
- **SC-004**: Invalid secret keys are rejected 100% of the time with no false positives.
- **SC-005**: When the local application is healthy, 99.9% of proxied requests complete successfully.
- **SC-006**: Subdomain collisions occur with probability less than 1 in 1 million (based on random subdomain generation strategy).
